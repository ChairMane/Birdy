# Birdy

Birdy is a discord bot meant for birders, and for those users who have interests in the birding community. The purpose of Birdy is to give access to information on various bird species for people who do not want to get off Discord. There are more functions and bird species being added as this project advances. This project was made purely to get some practice and experience working on something that will eventually be made public. I would also hope birders of Discord would use it and find it interesting.

## Prerequisites

Currently there are no prerequisites as this project is not ready to be publicly released.

# Functions (Currently Implemented)

At this moment, there are a few functions implemented. Some of these functions are going to be rewritten to be more efficient. There are also functions I have planned on making in the future. Some of these planned functions are to change the prefix from server-to-server (default prefix is ```<>```).

**Current functions implemented:**
- **```-- <shape_of_bird> ```** 
  - This function returns a list of birds to your private messages. (This function will be reworked as it does not categorize birds into correct families.)
  - **Example** ```<> sparrow```
	  	```<> finch```
		```<> falcon```
- **```<> <name_of_species>```**
  - This function returns an image of the bird with some basic info on the species.
  - **Example** ```<> white crowned sparrow```
	  	```<> american kestrel```
		```<> painted bunting```
