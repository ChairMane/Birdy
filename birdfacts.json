    "1": "There are over 9,500 species of birds in the world. Scientists typically group them into 30 categories. Birds are the most widespread of all animals around the world.",
    "2": "Approximately 2/3 of all the bird species are found in tropical rain forests.",
    "3": "Hoatzin chicks have two claws on each wing. When they climb out of the nest, they use their claws to hold on to mangrove trees. They lose their claws once they mature, but they remain poor flyers.",
    "4": "The longest feathers ever seen were on a chicken in Japan. Its tail feathers measured 34.7 feet (10.59 m) long.",
    "5": "To make them more lightweight, most birds do not have bladders to store urine. Rather than producing liquid urine to get rid of wastes, they produce a white, pasty substance. However, while an ostrich does not have a bladder like a mammalian bladder, it is unique among birds because it does have a complete separation of feces and urine.",
    "6": "A bird\u2019s lungs are much more complicated and efficient and take up more space than those of mammals, such as humans. A human\u2019s lungs compose about 1/20 of its body, but a bird\u2019s takes up 1/5.",
    "7": "The Australian pelican has the longest bill of any bird in the world. It is nearly 2 feet (0.5 m) in length. The sword-billed hummingbird, with its 3.9-inch (10 cm) bill, is the only bird with a bill that\u2019s longer than its body.",
    "8": "Owls cannot swivel their eyes. Instead they move their heads completely around to see straight behind them. They live on every continent except Antarctica. Soft fringes on their wings make their flight essentially silent.",

    "12": "In the continental U.S. alone, between 1.4 billion and 3.7 billion birds are killed by cats annually.",
    "13": "The only bird with nostrils at the end of its beak is the kiwi. This placement helps it sniff for food, such as worms and insects on the ground. It often snorts to clear its nostrils.",
    "14": "Unlike most birds that sing, a woodpecker will drum its beak against a tree. Other woodpeckers can identify which bird it is by the sound of the drumming.",

    "21": "The bird with the most feathers is the whistling swan, with up to 25,000 feathers. Hummingbirds, on the other hand, are so small that they have fewer than 1,000.",
    "22": "Falconry was developed more than 4,000 years ago in eastern and central Asia. Birds were used because they could kill animals beyond the range of a hunter\u2019s weapon. Genghis Khan reportedly had 10,000 falconers.",
    "23": "Coalminers often used canaries to detect poisonous levels of carbon monoxide gas. Miners knew that if the canary passed out, they were in danger, too. The phrase \u201cCanary in a Coalmine\u201d derives from this history.",
    "24": "The marsh warbler can mimic more than 80 different birds. Other renowned mimics include mockingbirds and lyrebirds.[1]",
    "25": "A pelican\u2019s pouch-like beak can hold up to 2.5 gallons of water at a time. The beak will shrink to squeeze out the water before the pelican swallows its food.",
    "26": "A vulture named the Lammergeyer will fly with bones high in the air and then drop them onto rocks. It will then eat the smashed bones, like a circus sword swallower.",

    "28": "Though it looks like a bird\u2019s knee is bending backwards, what is bending backward is actually its ankle. Below its ankle is an extended foot bone, leading to the toes. A bird\u2019s real knee is usually hidden by feathers.",
    "29": "The ostrich lays the biggest egg in the world. It measures 7\" x 5\" and weighs 3 pounds. However, the biggest egg for the size of the mother is laid by the kiwi and is a third of the weight of the bird. It is 5\" long and can weigh as much as 1 lb. This would be the equivalent of an ostrich laying an 88 lb. (40 kg.) egg.",
    "30": "The Malleefowl is famed for making a huge compost pile for its nest. Its eggs are incubated by the heat given off by the rotting vegetation.",
    "31": "Social weaverbirds live in huge communal nests that look like a huge haystack spread across a treetop. Some nests can weigh a few tons, have over 400 birds living in them, and may be 100 years old.",

    "39": "While most male birds do not have a penis, the Argentine Lake Duck\u2019s penis can extend 17\", the longest of any bird known. The duck itself is only about 16 inches tall. The base of the penis is covered with coarse spines, and the tip is soft and brush-like, perhaps to clean sperm that may have been deposited in the female\u2019s oviduct by another suitor. When not in use, the corkscrew shaped penis retracts into the duck\u2019s abdomen.",
    "40": "Approximately 75% of wild birds live for less than a year. The larger the bird, the more likely it is to live longer. The large wandering albatross, for example, can live for up to 80 years.",
    "41": "Gentoo Penguins are the fastest swimming birds, reaching speeds of 22 mph (36 kph). Emperor Penguins can stay under water for up to 18 minutes.",

    "44": "Bar-headed Geese fly across the Himalayas, the highest mountains in the world. They fly nearly 5 miles (over 8,000 m) up in the sky, almost as high as jet planes. The highest-flying bird is the Griffon Vulture. In 1973, one collided with an airplane more than 6.8 miles above the Ivory Coast in Africa.",
    "45": "The largest, tallest, and heaviest bird in the world is the ostrich. Male ostriches can reach up to 9 ft. tall (2.7 m) and weigh up to 350 lb. (160 kg). Their eyes are bigger than any other land animals' eyes and are even larger than their brain.",

    "50": "The Emperor Penguin is the only bird that lays its eggs in the middle of winter. By laying its eggs so early, it gives its young a head start. The babies need all spring, summer, and fall to grow big enough to survive the next winter.",
    "51": "Oilbirds eat oil palm fruits, which make the birds oily too. People near the caves where the oilbirds lived used to trap the oilbirds and boil them down for the oil.",
    "52": "The fastest flying bird in a dive is the Peregrine Falcon. It averages speeds of over 110 mph (180 kph).",
    "53": "Oilbirds are the only birds that use echolocation the way that bats do. However, bats are much better at it. A bat can even fly through the blades of a moving fan. Oilbirds are also the only nocturnal fruit-eating birds in the world.",

    "56": "The Sooty Tern spends more time in the air than any other bird. It takes off over the ocean and flies for at least 3 years without settling on water or land. Swifts also spend most of their lives in the air. They can even sleep in the air by gliding on air currents with their wings outstretched.",
    "57": "Birds don\u2019t fall off of a branch when they sleep because their toes automatically clench around the twig they are standing on. Because the grabbing action is done by tendons rather than muscles, the birds can sleep without danger of falling.",

    "60": "The linear flight formations of migratory birds are called echelons, with the most common shapes being the \u201cV\u201d or the \u201cJ.\u201d In fact, a true V-shaped formation is less common than a J formation. Birds fly in formation a) because it saves energy and b) to facilitate orientation and communication among the birds.",
    "61": "An albatross can soar for as long as six hours without moving its wings.",
    "62": "The heaviest bird in the air is the Kori Bustard, from East and South Africa. It weighs about 31 lb. (14 kg.), with the largest on recorded being 40 lb. (18 kg.). Because it is such hard work to fly, it flies only in emergencies and for only short distances.",

    "64": "What keeps a bird up in the air is the shape of its wings. The first humans to discover how birds stay aloft were Australian Aborigines when they invented the boomerang.",
    "65": "The fastest level flight by a bird has been seen in both the Spine-tailed Swift and the Red-breasted Merganser (a duck). They have flown at 100 mph (161 kph) in level flight.",
    "66": "The slowest flying bird is the American Woodcock. It can fly at just 5 mph (8 kph). When hummingbirds hover, they move at 0 mph. Additionally, hummingbirds are the only birds that can fly backwards under power, registering a negative speed.",

    "72": "Woodcocks and many ducks have their eyes placed at the sides of their heads so that they have a 360-degree field of vision.",
    "73": "A special arrangement of blood vessels cools the blood going out to the feet and warms the blood coming back, so even when standing on the ice, birds don\u2019t lose too much heat.",
    "74": "Both the Bee and the Vervain Hummingbirds build the smallest nests of all birds, measuring 3/4\" across and 1.2\" deep.",

    "77": "To attract a mate, a male Frigate bird will blow up its red throat pouch. The pouch can be as big as a person\u2019s head.",
    "78": "Over time, a surprising number of birds have lost their ability to fly. Being flightless has several advantages. For example, a flightless bird doesn\u2019t need to develop and carry large flight muscles or burn up the energy that flying requires. A flightless bird can also get by with less food, which means it can survive in places where food is scarce.",
    "79": "Depending on the species, a woodpecker\u2019s tongue can be up to 4\" long. It stores this long tongue by curling it in and sticking it through a specialized opening at the back of its neck, where it can then put it between the skull and skin.",
    "80": "The seagulls in the Alfred Hitchcock movie The Birds (1963) were fed a mixture of wheat and whisky so they would stand around and not fly too much.",

    "85": "Wind farms kill approximately a half-million birds per year in the United States, according to a 2008 Fish and Wildlife study. Nearly 10,000 birds, almost all of which are protected by the migratory bird acts, are killed every year at the wind farm in Altamont Pass, CA, alone.",
    "86": "Approximately 200 people have died since 1988 because of airborne collision between airplanes and birds. Bird strikes cause $300 million of damage each year to aircraft. The first recorded bird strike was in 1905, when Orville Wright\u2019s plane hit a bird and killed it.",

    "89": "The earliest known bird is the Archaeopteryx. It lived during the Jurassic period 150 million years ago. Because it did not have the basic features of flight, scientists are uncertain if it could fly.",
    "90": "Vultures have stomach acid so corrosive that they can digest carcasses infected with anthrax.",
    "91": "No other living being other than birds have feathers. The main function is to help them fly. They also waterproof birds and protect them from UV rays and other harmful elements.",
    "92": "Only one mammal can fly: the bat However, it flies differently from the bird. Insects also do not fly the same as birds.",
    "93": "A Bald Eagle is called \u201cbald\u201d because it is piebald (black and white), not because it doesn\u2019t have any feathers.",
    "94": "Eleven percent of the world\u2019s bird species is endangered. Draining wetlands and felling forests are the main causes of damage, but pollution and pesticides also play a part.",
    "95": "Before 1840, there were thousands of millions of passenger pigeons in North America. However, they were slaughtered for food until only one was left, a female called Martha. She died when she was 12 years old in 1914, in a zoo in Ohio.",
    "96": "More than 150 kinds of birds have become extinct since 1600, though many more may have died out that scientists don\u2019t know about. It wasn\u2019t just European explorers that killed bird species. Archeology shows that when people first arrived in ancient times in Hawaii and on islands in the South Pacific and Caribbean, they killed many birds Europeans had never seen before.",
    "97": "Someone who suffers from \"anatidaephobia\" believes that somewhere, somehow a duck or goose is constantly watching them. The word \"anatidaephobia\" is \u00a0from Greek word anatidae,\u00a0which means ducks, geese or other water fowls, and phobos is Greek for fear.",
